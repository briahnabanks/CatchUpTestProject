# Catch Up! Detroit
A game that allows you to drive through the Motor City while collecting classic Detroit icons and avoiding the obstacles.


## Story            
For our fifth challenge in the Apple Developer Acadamy Detroit, we were told to make an app that was a game. There were few requirements outside of that. With full creative reign, my team decided on a game that was true to ourselves as Detroiters, as well as our wonderful city. 
## Features
The main function of the game is a lateral swipe function. This allows you to move the vehicle side to side as the background scrolls. The users main goal is to collect the Detroit 
icons (Coney dog, Faygo pop, Buffs, etc) for points, while avoiding the "bad" icons (pothloles and construction barriers). Running into the potholes will lower the user's points, while hitting the construction barriers will stop the car and end the game. 
## Lessons Learned
This code was the first time I ever used the SpriteKit within XCode. It overall was a giant learning curve being new to coding entirely. we had 6 weeks to complete an entire game from start to finish. 

One of the most important things I learned this challenge is how to use GitHub. This was my first coding project working on code with a teammate, and it was essentail for us to collaborate. 

Another important thing I learned during this challenge is trial and error. I constantly ran into issues with this code, leaving me and my classmate to have to find fixes and also work arounds. I learned to come up with new ideas to pivot when necessary, to still finish with an app that we were proud of. 
## Acknowledgements
I would like to give acknowledgement to my team, JJABY VS. Everybody. Without the efforts from our project manager, designers, and coders this would not have been possible.
